# CS-210- Chada Clock.
This display an up  to date time in both 12 hour display and 24 hour display.
I was able to get through my hurdles quickly.
Knowing more C++ I think will allow me to do more cleaner code and I need to get better at commenting my code more.
Having to do a complete drawing of the display, I was very patient while I was doing the repetative symbols.
Having the patience of having to repeat the same synbol or same line of code having to repeat for a ling while.
I kept my code as clean as possible.
